There have been many papers and books published describing how to build and
analyze architectural models for quality attributes. Here are just a few examples.

## Availability

Many availability models have been proposed that operate at the architecture level of analysis. Just a few of these are [Gokhale 05] and [Yacoub 02]. 

A discussion and comparison of different black-box and white-box models for determining software reliability can be found in [Chandran 10]. 

A book relating availability to disaster recovery and business recovery is [Schmidt 10].

## Interoperability 

An overview of interoperability activities can be found in [Brownsword 04].

## Modifiability

Modifiability is typically measured through complexity metrics. The classic work on this topic is [Chidamber 94].

More recently, analyses based on design structure matrices have begun to appear [MacCormack 06].

## Performance

Two of the classic works on software performance evaluation are [Smith 01] and [Klein 93].

A broad survey of architecture-centric performance evaluation approaches can be found in [Koziolek 10].

## Security

Checklists for security have been generated by a variety of groups for different domains. See for example:
* Credit cards, generated by the Payment Card Industry: www.pcisecurity-standards.org/security_standards/
* Information security, generated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): [NIST 09].
* Electric grid, generated by Advanced Security Acceleration Project for the Smart Grid: www.smartgridipedia.org/index.php/ASAP-SG
* Common Criteria. An international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) for computer security certification: www.commoncriteriaportal.org

## Testability
Work in measuring testability from an architectural perspective includes measur-ing testability as the measured complexity of a class dependency graph derived from UML class diagrams, and identifying class diagrams that can lead to code that is difficult to test [Baudry 05]; and measuring controllability and observabil-ity as a function of data flow [Le Traon 97].

## Usability

A checklist for usability can be found at www.stcsig.org/usability/topics/articles/he-checklist.html

## Safety

A checklist for safety is called the Safety Integrity Level: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_Integrity_Level 

## Applications of Modeling and analysis

For a detailed discussion of a case where quality attribute modeling and analysis played a large role in determining the architecture as it evolved through a number of releases, see [Graham 07].
