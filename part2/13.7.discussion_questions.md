1. What’s the difference between an architectural pattern, such as those de-scribed in this chapter and in the Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture series of books, and design patterns, such as those collected by the Gang of Four in 1994 and many other people subsequently? Given a pattern, how would you decide whether it was an architectural pattern, a design pattern, a code pattern, or something else?
2. SOA systems feature dynamic service registration and discovery. Which quality attributes does this capability enhance and which does it threaten? If you had to make a recommendation to your boss about whether your company’s SOA system should use external services it discovers at runtime, what would you say?
3. Write a complete pattern description for the “competence center” work as-signment pattern mentioned in Section 13.2.
4. For a data set that is a set of web pages, sketch a map function and a reduce function that together provide a basic search engine capability.
5. Describe how the layered pattern makes use of these tactics: abstract com-mon services, encapsulate, and use an intermediary.
