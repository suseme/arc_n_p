12 Other Quality Attributes 其他质量属性

_Quality is not an act, it is a habit._  
—Aristotle

Chapters 5–11 each dealt with a particular quality attribute important to software systems. Each of those chapters discussed how its particular quality attribute is defined, gave a general scenario for that quality attribute, and showed how to write specific scenarios to express precise shades of meaning concerning that quality attribute. And each gave a collection of techniques to achieve that quality attribute in an architecture. In short, each chapter presented a kind of portfolio for specifying and designing to achieve a particular quality attribute.

Those seven chapters covered seven of the most important quality attributes, in terms of their occurrence in modern software-reliant systems. However, as is no doubt clear, seven only begins to scratch the surface of the quality attributes that you might find needed in a software system you’re working on.

Is cost a quality attribute? It is not a technical quality attribute, but it certainly affects fitness for use. We consider economic factors in Chapter 23.

This chapter will give a brief introduction to a few other quality attributes—a sort of “B list” of quality attributes—but, more important, show how to build the same kind of specification or design portfolio for a quality attribute not covered in our list.
